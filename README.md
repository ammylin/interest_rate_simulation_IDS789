# interest_rate_simulation_IDS789
As part of my first assignment for IDS 789: Fundamentals of Finance Business Models at Duke University, I aim to model and simulate possible future paths of 3-month interest rates to help set an appropriate rate for a new Certificate of Deposit (CD) product. 

Assuming today's interest rate is 5% and that daily rate changes follow a lognormal process with:

- Mean: 0%

- Standard Deviation: 0.625% per day

The simulation uses a Monte Carlo approach to generate and visualize 10 possible interest rate paths over a 3-month period (daily intervals), implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

ðŸ“Š Key Features:

- Lognormal modeling of interest rate changes

- Daily simulation over a 3-month horizon

- Visualization of 10 scenario paths

This model can assist in risk assessment and strategic pricing for short-term fixed-income products.
